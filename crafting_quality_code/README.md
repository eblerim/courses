# Crafting Quality Code

As the name suggest this course was about crafting quality code, which means the course provided an introduction to some of the concepts, principles and tools that professional programmers use in their daily work.

Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) of the course were: 
* algorithm design
* automated testing using unittest and doctest
* runtime complexity
* object-oriented programming, and
* advance use of functions and exceptions.

The course was taught by Jeniffer Campell and Paul Gries of University of Toronto, and for more information follow the [course homepage](https://www.coursera.org/learn/program-code) at Coursera.
