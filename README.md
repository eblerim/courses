# Courses

This is my public GitHub repository for some of the online courses I have finished, and that I have decided to share and version control as part of my plan to extend my social presence with interested and likeminded people and organizations.

## Introduction

As many full-time employees, I have limited time and have to be highly selective in deciding which courses to take in order to enrich my practical professional development. Based on this premise, I implement the Pareto principle (aka 80/20 principle or minimum effective dose) and am aiming to build just-in-time competence instead of just-in-case (good to have) competence. Furthermore, my focus is on project-based learning, and thus I am primarily interested in solving various problem sets and projects.

Despite this being a public repository on GitHub, I will not accept any pull requests. Since this is a repository of my solutions and notes, and not a community-driven effort. However, I encourage everyone to contribute in their own way by creating and sharing their own solutions and notes.
